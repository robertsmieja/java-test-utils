This project is intended to serve as a set of common utilities used in testing, between my personal project.

It currently consists of a set of utilities to simplify unit testing of all getters/setters, equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods.

### Requirements:
* Java 1.8 or newer
* JUnit 5.0.0-M3 or newer
* IDE support for JUnit 5 (Currently only IntelliJ IDEA)

### Usage
See [this unit test](src/test/java/com/robertsmieja/test/utils/junit/SimplePojoTests.java) as an example of how to use the current implementation.

### Issues
If there are any bugs, or ideas on how to improve these classes, please open a new GitHub issue.
